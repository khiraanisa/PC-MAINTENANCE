## Reflection 🧠
Recently, I learned how to assemble PC hardware in my Technology and Information System class, gaining hands-on experience with computer components. The process began with reinstalling the CPU fan, followed by placing the hard disk and RAM into their respective slots. Next, I installed the power supply unit (PSU) and carefully connected all the necessary cables and connectors to ensure proper functionality. This lesson was a great learning experience, giving me confidence in handling computer hardware independently. I believe this knowledge will be valuable for me in the future, whether for personal use or professional applications.
