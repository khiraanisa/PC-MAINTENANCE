## Reflection
Recently on 20th October 2024, I have learned on how to assemble the PC hardware during Technology and Information System class. Firstly, we need to put CPU fan back to its place. Then, hard disk and followed by RAM are also put back into their places. After that, we need to install the power supply back to its place. Lastly, assemble all the cables to their respective places.
I had a very great experience during the lesson. I now know how to assemble PC hardwares all on my own. I hope everything that I had learned will be useful for me in the future.
